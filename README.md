# WALLFACER

## ABOUT

This project is an 2d n-body simulation that I made mainly because I was interested in the subject after watching Netflix’s “3 Body Problem” (and I plan to read the book at some point).
I started writing it on a plane chipped away at it when I had spare time so the overall design of the project is *interesting*.
For the time being I think of it as a small pet project so I am unlikely to overhaul it to be better designed.

## USAGE

There are multiple binaries that show different configurations of astral body simulations. To run one, use, for example:

"cargo run --bin 'solar_system'"

To see a list of all the binaries, run "cargo run" and cargo will display the available binaries


## PLANNED FEATURES

- FPS + System energy display
- Store configurations as JSON
- Optimise using quadtrees
